                        The design of this website is very clean and the embedded videos change based on the season and
                        current
                        product releases, but they are always very entertaining and exciting. The links to different
                        categories and
                        more information are easy to find on the header and the minimal design helps the videos not be
                        overwhelming.

                    <p>
                        Many news websites are not very clean/organized, which was something that definitely annoyed me
                        when I was taking a Journalism class in Fall 2024, but the Associated Press website is very
                        clean and organized but
                        also visually interesting. The images in the grid also change, which is satisfying to watch,
                        though I do wish you could click
                        on the images to see the article that goes with them.

                    <a href="https://www.news10.com/"><img src="baddesign1.jpg" alt="photo of NEWS10 ABC's website"></a>

        <div class="designexplanation">

                    <div class="center"><a class="pinkbutton" href="https://www.news10.com/">NEWS10 ABC</a></div>
                    <p>
                        I think this website is really disorganized/ cluttered and having black as the background color
                        makes it feel
                        very dark and overwhelming. I hate how enormous the banner ad is at the top and it actually
                        hides most of the
                        content that viewers should be seeing first. I also think the dropdowns in the navigation menu
                        are really ugly. Also,
                        all of the story names are so bright/stark from the black and so close together that it hurts my
                        eyes to try to read them.
